The c++ project is in the BackTesterDemo, the python file is in the BackTesterPython.

My data is the fx rate of USD/CNY from quandl, which is stored in CUR-CNY2019.csv.

My strategy is simply the 14-day RSI.

To see how the PNLs match from two source, see the two plots. 

Something to explain:
I used vscode (which I know is not recommended) to remotely run my code in Linux system with the help of Ubuntu.
This may result in some failures when opening the project in Windows. But my cmake files all reload successfully 
in Linux, as well as building and compiling.
